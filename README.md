A simple illustration to run RKHS-SHAP, GP-SHAP, and BayesGPSHAP to explain kernel methods and Gaussian process.

The algorithms used in this repo came primarily out of the following papers. If you use RKHS-SHAP or GP-SHAP in your research we would appreciate a citation to the appropriate paper(s):
